			<h1>Welcome to the ArchT4 Home!</h1>
			
			<p>ArchT4 is a Discord-based bot home with bots covering a multitude of possible features. The Github repository home to the bot contains several
			ongoing projects. It contains a base project which acts as the lead of ArchT4 as well as a bunch of other multipurpose bots each with their own
			set theme. Each themed bot has its own branch seperate from the core ArchT4. The core is only updated when an update is required for all of the
			ArchT4 family bots. These updates are then merged for each individual branch with a pull request.</p>
