			<h1>Welcome to the ArchT4 Home!</h1>
			
			<p>ArchT4 is a Discord-based bot home with bots covering a multitude of possible features. The Github repository home to the bot contains several
			ongoing projects. It contains a base project which acts as the lead of ArchT4 as well as a bunch of other multipurpose bots each with their own
			set theme. Each themed bot has its own branch seperate from the core ArchT4. The core is only updated when an update is required for all of the
			ArchT4 family bots. These updates are then merged for each individual branch with a pull request.</p>

			<h1>What bots are currently being worked on?</h1>
			<p>Not including the core bot, the only bots and projects being worked on right now are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="NotFound.html">Arcaderr</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="NotFound.html">DDJ</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="NotFound.html">???</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<p>These projects are currently being prioritizied and are all expecting a Release 1.0 in the next couple of months. These aren't the only active projects
			but are the only ones expected to get big releases and updates. Smaller Projects like ArchT1 (T0B1 Python V2) are still in development yet are more behind
			the scenes. These will only get information updates once a new release is fully finished.</p>
			<p>These bots are hosted in the "Home" discord. A discord originally made to be a community interaction sertver, now transformed into a bot-ran server
			designed to improve user experience. The main "Dev Branch" bot can be found there with the latest bot beta enabled. This shows off in-development
			features and how they might work. The main series bots like Arcaderr can be found here will fully implemented and stble features. These will provide the
			best user experience. The main series bots will also be hosted 24/7 in contrast to the Dev Branch bots which will only be hosted during testing days and
			~24 hours after a new build is tested.</p>
			
			<h1>Could you make a bot for me?</h1>
			<p>Simple answer, yes. It just depends how much work it would require and I would need to take into consideration my current workload. If I honestly didn't
			have the time, I wouldn't make it. Send me a DM over discord and I could get you a bot sorted. Just don't make me build it and have you not use it. They're
			free.</p>
