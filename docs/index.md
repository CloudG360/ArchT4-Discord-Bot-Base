# ArchT4
### A Multipurpose Discord bot base.

## What is ArchT4?

Architechure 4 is the 4th revision of my Discord bot base. This base bot can be adapted into other bot purposes quickly and easily with the base managment commands and systems already in place. The main purpose is just to make command creation quicker with all the needed tools already provided.

## Not that interesting, is it? Only a base?

Not at all! The base bot is only the main part of this project. Many different bots are currently in development under the Arch T4 family name. Bots like Arcaderr and DjPlus. While they are no where near complete, they will to the attractive part of this project and will be the publically hosted bots.

## Milestones

Milestones will be set in relation to project releases and overhauls. Multiple full-featured bots will be worked on simultaneously but 1 will take priority. This bot will be presented it's own milestone.
